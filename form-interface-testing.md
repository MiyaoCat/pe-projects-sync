- Could you find them? Was it difficult? Easy? Was it at user/projects/e4p ?
- How is the index page? Is it clear what the page is for a first-time visitor? - Are the links clear?
Then â€“ per form:

- How is the storytelling? Is it clear what the forms are supposed to do?
- Are the inputs and buttons legible? Do they have labels?
- Does the form work? Can you break it?
- Do things jump around when you interact with them?
- Is the outcome clear?
- Do the form styles match across all forms?
- Is it a pleasure to use?
- What could be improved?


# Jesse

- [x] Easy to find.
## Index Page
- I like that it has the same style as his homepage. 
- I LOVE the buttons.  So fun to hover and feel like your pressing them down. 
- I can't say it's super clear what the page is for other than a collection of Form Prctice. A first time visitor probably wouldn't know what's going on, but they'd definitely click on one of the six buttons. 

## Forms
- Overall, it was a pleasure to use the forms. My main critique is the font size is a little small for me (am I getting old??). 

### Area 
- I understand the form calculates the area of a room. 
- I would add the units of measurement. 
- You could take it a step further and allow the user to select imperial or metric system.
- I like that the button reads 'Calculate'. Makes it very clear. 
## Paint Calculation
- Same as area, just needs unit of measurement. 
## Self-Checkout
- The font feels a bit small
- I can't use decimals for price (not something we learned yet)
## Simple Math
- I didn't quite know what to expect, but cool to see the 4 calculations spit out. 

# Andy
- [x] Easy to find.
## Index Page
- First sentence lets me know what this is page is for. Also tells me that the list below are buttons/links to explore. 
## Forms
- Forms are super clear of their intention and desired outcome. Only thing I'd add is a back button to get back to the index page. 
### Simple Math
- I like that you allow for decimals. I'll have to look at your code for that.
### Room Area
- You display in meters too! Awesome!

# Steve
- [x] Easy to find.
## Index Page
- I like the layout! 
- May add something to the links to signify they're links. 
- Maybe add a short sentence explaining what this is.
## Forms
### Ask a Question
- Great looking form. I like the large text box.
- I was able to enter a string of text in the email without using an @ sign. I believe if you use `input="email"` it'll require an @
### Calculate Paycheck
- Good idea for a form! Can you calculate take-home after taxes? Might be too depressing (haha)
- It's prefilled with data, maybe use a placeholder instead. 
- Doesn't allow for decimals (you're probably already aware)
### Drinking Age
- We haven't learned this yet, but I'd like to click on the year and see a more years (not really describing this well) so its easier to click on my birth year.

# Tara
- [x] Easy to find
## Index Page 
- Styling? I'm assuming ti's still to come. 
## Forms
- I like the header font. Feels like a class notebook. 
- Submit button is relatively small to the rest of the copy
### Mad Lib
- I'd like to see the input fields lined up. It looks like Derek covers that here: https://perpetual.education/resources/styling-forms-part-1/
### Retirement Calculator
- Page didn't work

# Ned
- [x] Easy to find
## Index Page 
- I like the shade of yellow! It's very calming. 
- The link fonts are a little small for me (Man, I really do think I'm getting old now!)
## Forms
- Submit button is clear. 
- I don't know if it's my eyes getting worse, but the <p> text is too small for me. 
### Berry Count-O-Matic
- I thought the form didn't work, but then I saw the result in green. It's really hard to see. 
- I like how you styled the forms.
- The text above the input fields seems small compared to the title and submit button.
### Star Data Entry Sheet
- I'm not really sure what to expect after entering the info. 
### Pizza Party
- You show slices left over, awesome!
- I'd like to know how many slices per pizza written somewhere.
# Burooj
- [x] Easy to find
## Index Page 
- Wow! This looks fun. I don't know what it is, but it feels fun. I guess I'll click away!
- Second time around I noticed you numbered each line on hover, sweet!
## Forms
- Lots of cool CSS going on. I really like how you styled the output. Makes it super easy and clear to read. 
- Also really cool how you can click into the input field and it changes colors and font. 
- That back button, so helpful!
- Sorry, Burooj, I couldn't go through all the forms, but you definitely set the bar with styling and some of the functions. I even copied some of your styling.
