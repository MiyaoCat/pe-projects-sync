I followed along with the video. I did not experience any of the fatal errors that Derek was experiencing. 

If I left a form field blank, it would return a zero. My code wasn't any different. Maybe my browser is more up-to-date? Or Sublime is doing something. 

These are the different form types (that we went over in the video, could be more)

<form> 

	<input type="text" name="text">

	<input type="number" name="number">

	<input type="email" name="email">

	<input type="password" name="password">

	<input type="submit" name="submit">

	<input type="range" name="range">

	<button type="submit" name="submitted">
</form>

Input Name: Is a specific name/id that we use to refer to the input field. 

Can target any attribute in CSS: 

Ex. [type='submit']

GET request = Receive something
POST request = Send something (up to the server)

The way to tell the form we want to post is with the attribute method
Ex. <form method='POST'>

Floatval will turn the string into a number

Superglobal Variables
The server (wherever that may be) is storing the info somewhere

$stuff = $_POST
In video the video example, guests, berries and submitted data (array) is stored in the super global variable. 

QUESTION
Is the super global variable ($_POST) ALWAYS going to be that? When we create a form, will we always use $_POST to send and store our form data?
