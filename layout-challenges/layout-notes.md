#Layout Challenge Notes:

##Setup
- Take the initial time to setup the layout.
- Draw out the modules. Draw boxes around groups of content. 
	 - This will help with the HTML and knowing where to wrap elements
- Write out the HTML. 
- Fill in the content before styling.
- Write out CSS structure scoped to elements 
	- Then fill in the CSS styling of elemnts 


##Use a Fake Loop!
- Can use fake PHP loop to repeat content. 
	- <?php foreach ( [1, 2, 3] as $variable ) { ?>
- Created a JSON file and added data to the file and looped through.
- Took more effort than needed for the assignment goal



##Grid
- Good use case to equally separate elements with gap. 
	 - Can be a single column (mobile view). More efficient than padding/margin

**Changing where elements display in Grid**
- Timestape 42:20
- Define the gride and how to specify where elements display in the grid
- Child elements
	- grid-column: 1/3 (spans column numbers 1 to 3)
	- grid-row: 2/3 (starts at row number 2, ends at row number 3)

- Play around with layout. Add more images, cards and see how grid reacts

##Workflow
- Duplicate window
	- One to view with inspector tool
	- One to view just the page
- Use HTML validator more when running into issues

##Misc
- Make use of vh/vw for padding/margin
- Zoom out of window to better view the whole page
- Be clear about the layout! Take time to declare the right rules for the layout.
